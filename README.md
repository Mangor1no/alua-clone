# React Tailwind Boilerplate
  
  ## Description 
  
  
  I always get bored when I have to start a new project. Many configurations, tools, folder structure, etc. make me dizzy everytimes. After several projects, I decided to make my own boilerplate, which contains my most frequent library and configurations for a ReactJS project.
